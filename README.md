## Meta Ads Performance Analysis (Mock Data)

## Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world Meta Ads campaign performance analysis using Python and Power BI. The objective is to evaluate marketing efficiency and support data-driven decision-making by analyzing core advertising KPIs such as CTR, CPC, CPM, and ROAS.
The analysis mirrors how marketing and AI teams monitor daily ad performance, identify inefficiencies, and optimize budget allocation.

## Business Problem
Digital marketing teams need to understand which campaigns, creatives, and audiences generate the highest return on ad spend (ROAS). Without structured analysis, inefficient campaigns may continue to consume budget without delivering revenue.

This project demonstrates how data analytics can be used to:
- Monitor daily ad performance
- Compare campaign efficiency
- Identify optimization opportunities

## Dataset
Mock Meta Ads data generated using Python, covering:
- 60 days of campaign activity
- Multiple campaigns, ad sets, and creative types
- Daily impressions, clicks, spend, conversions, and revenue

## Key KPIs
- CTR (Click-Through Rate)
- CPC (Cost Per Click)
- CPM (Cost Per 1,000 Impressions)
- ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)
- Conversion Rate
- AOV (Average Order Value)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Power BI (DAX, interactive dashboards)
- Google Colab
- GitHub

## Key Insights
- Traffic campaigns show a higher average ROAS despite the lowest CPC
- Video creatives deliver the highest ROAS while maintaining the lowest CPC, despite similar CTR across creative formats.
- Higher ad spend does not always correlate with higher ROAS, indicating inefficient budget allocation.
- Certain campaigns generate strong revenue despite moderate spend, presenting scaling opportunities.

## Recommendations
- Reallocate budget from high-spend, low-ROAS campaigns to high-performing creatives.
- Scale traffic campaigns with consistently strong ROAS.
- Monitor daily performance trends to identify inefficiencies and creative fatigue quickly.

## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides:
- Executive overview of spend, revenue, CTR, and ROAS
- Daily spend vs revenue trends
- Campaign and creative-level performance breakdown
- Interactive filters for date, campaign, and creative type
